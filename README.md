# Foundation Demo Page

Please see below for questions and comments I made along the way.

## QUESTIONS:

- What exact color should the "PERFECT BLOOD SUGAR" be?
- Which part of the document is "Deck Copy"? (Deck Copy Font: Brandon Grotesque on Typekit)

## COMMENTS:

- Had it been a real project I would have optimized the images for web.
- I added the (...) after "... years" in the **brown bar section** which was in the HTML Mock Up copy, but not in the image.
- I added the (.) after "... switch it back on" in the **red gears section** which was in the HTML Mock Up copy, but not in the image.
- There was not an image(s) for the "Order NOW & RECEIVE FREE SHIPPING" Berbinex C3 bottles. I used a screenshot and trimmed the edges in Photoshop for the time being.
- On the image there is text that is repeated. Starting with line "So let's do this" through line "And thatâ€™s an important question". (I went with the content in the HTML Mock Up instead of repeating).
- Had it been a real project I would updated the image file names and add correct alt tags for SEO.

## TODO:

- add correct html element types (e.g. `<footer>`)
- use chrome's print full screen feature
- add to gitHub
- add MS and Moz flex properties
